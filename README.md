# Chess Project

This repository contains a skeleton implementation of a functional-style C++ chess game intended for Unreal Engine GUI integration.

## Components

- **Start Page**: Handles user login and registration.
- **Game Setup Page**: Select between AI vs Player or Player vs Player, choose colors or random, and set time limits.
- **Game Page**: Implements the chess game on an 8x8 board with full rules (castling, en passant, promotion, etc.) using functional programming principles.

The code is organized under `src/` as plain C++ headers and source files. Unreal Engine integration and GUI are left for implementation within the engine's framework.
